### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is my current alter ego: [Sundin](https://github.com/Sundin)

I worked for WirelessCar from 2019-2021 and did a lot of great stuff!

Some of the work I'm the most proud of:
* Spearheaded the migration from Gerrit to Github.
* Created a full service that runs its integration tests towards a separate service instance for every pull request, using only 4 repos for the entire service. (Documentation [here](https://github.com/WirelessCar/cdx-service) and [here](https://github.com/WirelessCar/isolated-environments-poc)).
* Implemented a [sonic image](https://github.com/WirelessCar/create-change-ticket) for automatically creating change enablement tickets.
